# Notes

1. **Improve Code Quality**
    - ways to improve code quality:
      - refactoring
      - testing
      - re-use (DRY) "Don't repeat yourself" rule of three
      - clean clode
      - self documented code. and or good comments in code ()
      - simply branching code
      - bug test search out edge cases
      - linter
      - error logging
    - ways to test our code
      - write assertions
      - console.log() and other console methods .....
      - UAT testing 
      - unit testing
      - integration testing
      - E2E testing
      - Regression test
      - manual testing
        - pros: experience it as a user, test diff. workflows or use-case, test how the app is used
        - cons: time consuming, slow, not repeatable, human error
        - console.log(), console.assert(), console.error() etc.
        - click through app
        - driver code and run functions
        - could test with different timeOut/ delay
        - test for edge cases
      - automated testing
        - pros: speed, repeatable, saves debugging, force more dry modular code
        - cons: speed (takes time to setup), false postives
2. **TDD**
    - TDD is...
     - Test Driven Development
