# Notes

1. **Improve Code Quality**
    - ways to improve code quality:
      - refactor
      - linter
      - comment or self documenting code
      - keep code DRY 
      - bug testing
    - ways to test 
      - use console.assert(), console.error() etc.
      - function to test
      - UAT testing 
      - manual testing 
         * pros: make sure it works, use different workflows or use case
         * cons: human error, in-consistent, slow, lots of time to test
      - automated testing
        * pros: speed (after setup), consistent, create unit tests, Force more DRY code
        * cons: false positive, time on setup,  
        - build some tests to use console.assert()
        - test frameworks / libraries
